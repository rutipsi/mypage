# 🌐 Rutip's Page
hey! im rutip and i always wanted to have my personal website as kid but lacked the funds and the knowledge. finally i have some money to spare to my hobby
and this professionally made - beautiful template from [Sanju](https://github.com/Spikeysanju). without him this wouldn't exist. i probably would've
just copied someone else's lmao. my brain's too small to learn this but i had cs major and i do know few things and that is how i was able to 
edit the original template which is hard to do ngl.

## 📖 about project
im not a coder or web dev, this is not my original creation - this is a fork sanju's personal website [template](https://github.com/Spikeysanju/sanju.sh)
this is a simple personal website i built using [astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator. i chose Astro for its speed, flexibility, and ease of use. i hope you like the site!


## ✨ features
- **blog**: a collection of my blog posts and articles
- **notes**: a place for me to share my random thoughts and ideas (more like tweets or quotes)
- **photos**: a photo gallery for my image posts

## 🛠️ tech stack
- **astro**: static site generator
- **tailwindcss**: utility-first css framework for rapid prototyping
- **markdown**: for writing content in a simple and easy-to-read format
- **typescript**: for type-checking and better code quality 
- **biome**: Format, lint, and more in a fraction of a second.
- **cloudflare pages**: for hosting the site and continuous deployment

## 🎨 design
- i wanted to keep the design simple and clean. i used a monochrome color scheme with a pop of color for the accent. 
- i also used a lot of whitespace to make the content easy to read and navigate. 
- i'm a big fan of minimalism and KISS (keep it simple, stupid) and i think it works well for a personal website like this. 
- i hope you like the design as much as i do!

## 🔧 environment variables
To add analytics to your site, you can use Umami and Clarity. you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```plaintext
# Umami Analytics
UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=your_umami_website_id
UMAMI_TRACKING_URL=your_umami_tracking_url

# Clarity Analytics
CLARITY_TRACKING_ID=your_clarity_tracking_id
```

if you don't want to use analytics, you can remove the analytics code from the [src/components/seo/base-head.astro](https://github.com/rutip/mypage/blob/main/src/components/seo/base-head.astro) file and remove the umami and clarity scripts.
